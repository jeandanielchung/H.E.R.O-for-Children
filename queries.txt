        2) the criteria that is being searched for (?)
            -might be nice to have 
                - ex. range of ages, 13-17
                - can specify which kid is what age
            -might be redundant in some scenarios
                - ex. peanut allergies
                - a redundant list of "peanut allergy" down the second column
